# Emotion-based-Music-Recommendation-System

ABSTRACT:

Music recommendation systems have been around for a long time, but it can be difficult for a person to choose which music to listen to from a large collection of available selections.
Humans frequently use their facial expressions to convey their messages more effectively.In light of this, we offer a novel method of music selection in which a person's sentiment is deduced from their webcam-captured facial expression.The system recognises a user's facial expressions and extracts facial landmarks that can be used to categorise the user's emotional state. Once the emotion has been determined, the user will be presented with a list of songs that most accurately reflect their current state of mind. The next songs will be suggested based on the same genre or kind once the user chooses one song. The system's overarching goal is to effectively identify facial emotion and make song recommendations. Both time and money will be saved by the suggested system.

Methodology:

Project is trained on an MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) model using the FER (Facial Emotion Recognition) updated dataset, with a goal to classify facial expressions into distinct emotion categories, including sadness, happiness, neutrality, surprise, fear, and anger. We have leveraged deep learning techniques to capture subtle features in facial expressions and successfully classify them into multiple emotional states. The project encompasses data preprocessing, model training, validation, and testing phases, and it underscores the challenges of handling diverse expressions, variations in lighting, and demographic factors. The accuracy and reliability of our MTCNN-based emotion recognition model position it as a valuable tool for applications spanning human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and personalized content recommendation.
